The **Open Source IoC Analyser** is a cybersecurity tool designed to help users rapidly assess potential threats by analyzing various Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s used and its significance:

Problem It Solves ðŸŽ¯
Cybersecurity teams often face:

Time-consuming manual checks: Validating IoCs (files, IPs, domains, etc.) across multiple platforms.

Fragmented threat intelligence: Data scattered across VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, and other APIs.

Proactive detection gaps: Reliance on cloud-based scans without local rule-based analysis.

This tool streamlines these processes into a single, unified workflow.
