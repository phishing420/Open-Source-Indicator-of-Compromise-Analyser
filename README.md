The **Open Source IoC Analyser** is a cybersecurity tool designed to help users rapidly assess potential threats by analyzing various Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs used and its significance:

Problem It Solves üéØ
Cybersecurity teams often face:

      Time-consuming manual checks: Validating IoCs (files, IPs, domains, etc.) across multiple platforms.
      
      Fragmented threat intelligence: Data scattered across VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, and other APIs.
      
      Proactive detection gaps: Reliance on cloud-based scans without local rule-based analysis.

This tool streamlines these processes into a single, unified workflow.

Who Should Use It? üë•
SOC Analysts: Triage alerts and investigate IoCs.

Threat Hunters: Proactively hunt for malware or infrastructure linked to APTs.

IT Teams: Validate suspicious files/URLs reported by employees.

Cybersecurity Students: Practice real-world threat analysis.

Ethical Considerations ‚ö†Ô∏è
Compliance: Follow API terms of service (e.g., VirusTotal‚Äôs scanning limits).

Responsible Use: Avoid scanning third-party systems without authorization.

Educational Focus: Designed for research, not production-grade threat intelligence.
